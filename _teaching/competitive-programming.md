Taught students coursework in algorithms & computability in private as well as through educational institutions. Coursework included preparation for the USACO Bronze, Silver and Gold divisions, as well as for ACSL and the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC).

Additional duties included mentoring the Kennedy Middle School math team to qualify for the Mathcounts State championship (<10th percentile).

I was also responsible for having bi-weekly 1-1s with students and parents to discuss students' progress, as well as providing summaries after every class.
