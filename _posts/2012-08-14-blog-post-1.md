How to earn a Bachelors degree in 2 years.

---

Intro
====

This December, I will be graduating from the University of California, Berkeley at the age of 18, continuing onto the MS Computer Science program at Georgia Tech as one of the youngest ever matriculated students in the program. I am often asked how and why I was able to graduate so early, and what my goals were at the time. I hope this post will clarify my personal goals and motivations, as well as how to adopt a similar educational plan for those seeking to graduate early.

Motivations
====

When I was 16, I wanted to be financially independent from my parents and my legal guardian at the time, and I also wanted to be able to contribute to family finances and to support people I cared about when it mattered. One of the steps towards achieving this goal was a college degree - I wanted to work in tech and I realized that most engineers had degrees, or at least went to a reputable institution and later dropped out aftering securing an adequate full-time offer. I had previously competed in programming competitions, but otherwise had no significant background in mathematics, with my very first course in community college being an introduction to Calculus.

Timeline
====

My goal was to simultaneously advance my education and become more self-sufficient. I concluded that attending community college in California was the best choice for me at the time, as it would give me the flexibility to pick up internships and the classes I took could eventually transfer towards degree in the University of California system. 

January 2022: I enrolled at De Anza College part-time through a dual enrollment program at my high school, and took the maximum units allowed (8 per quarter)

March 2023: I passed the California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE), a California version of the GED that enables students to leave high school and attend community college full-time. 

June 2023: I left high school and took 15 units over the Summer after my unit cap was removed. I would overload on units in this and every future term.

August 2023: I enrolled as a visiting student at [SF State](https://www.ccsf.edu/sites/default/files/2020/document/SFConsortium.pdf) and [CSU East Bay](https://www.csueastbay.edu/futurestudents/ebcan/cross-enrollment.html) to take upper-division classes. Typically, community colleges only offer lower-divion (1st and 2nd year) classes. However, you can take upper-division (3rd and 4th year) or graduate classes at schools in the CSU system through the Open-University program, or through cross-enrollment programs at community college, transferring the credit to your eventual degree-granting institution after matriculating. This is risky, as your transfer institution may not accept the units, or may not grant equivalency for those classes to your major requirements. I minimized the risk by emailing the Berkeley Math Department in advance and obtaining a confirmation of equivalency before taking upper division and graduate classes outside the university.

January 2024: I enrolled as a visiting student at [UC Berkeley](https://laney.edu/transfer/cross-enrollment-program/ucb/), taking Honors Introduction to Complex Analysis (Math H185), and also took Measure Theory (a graduate class) at SF State.

April 2024: I was accepted to Berkeley, and committed!

June 2024: I transferred to Berkeley and took two classes over the Summer, completing 6/8 upper division major requirements before my intended first semester.

August 2024: I took 18 units of classes at Berkeley and 2 graduate classes, ending the semester with 114 units

December 2024: I took 6 units of Winter Intersession classes at community college to reach 120 units.

January 2025: I completed my winter intersession classes and was awarded my degree. I also transferred credit for the two grad courses I took at Berkeley to my MS at Georgia Tech.

In summary, I graduated in 2 years, spending my first semester in college as a part-time student. I was only a matriculated student at Berkeley for about eight months, but had been involved in student organizations for nearly a year due to starting as a visiting student in Spring 2024. As a community college student, your chances of getting into a UC school are much higher. Even if I was rejected from the school I wished to attend (Berkeley), the upper division courses I took would have transferred to any UC school I committed to, as I had chosen classes that would have equivalent major requirement courses for the majors I applied for.

Conclusion
====
What's the takeaway? You don't need to be as smart as Terence Tao to graduate early. What is needed is resourcefulness, proactivity, planning, and the resilience to take tough courses and eventually acclimate to their difficulty. I was constantly scouting for opportunities to take hard courses to both improve my university applications and advance my education, and oftentimes had to go out of my way to inquire about these programs and secure classes I was actually interested in. 

Additionally, I was never afraid to sacrifice my GPA if it meant I got to take harder courses, learn more, and obtain credit. I struggled in many of my classes--sometimes I ended with a disappointing grade. However, that did not stop me from challenging myself to take more and more difficult coursework after every semester, a philosophy that led me to advance from high school geometry to graduate measure theory in just one year. 

Most importantly, you also need to have a solid plan after graduation, and you need to ensure that graduating early will not impact your goals. For me, that goal was to become a software engineer, a career path which does not care for GPA or major, and resides in an industry which is very welcoming of young professionals. If your goal is graduate school, medical school, or anything similar, you need to be very careful to ensure a high GPA even when taking on the heavy courseloads required for early graduation. 

I believe most young adults in the States or in Canada can follow a similar path to mine with similar effects. I am sure there exist similar programs to the ones I took advantage of, wherever one may live. At the end of the day, it falls to the individual to clarify their goals, and be proactive in seeking out enrichment opportunities.
