Hey there! I'm Shiwei, a 2nd-year Mathematics & Computer Science major at De Anza College. Presently, I am a software engineering intern at Heimdall Data, where I work on caching and querying processes within the Heimdall proxy.

My main interests are broadly in applied mathematics, specifically machine learning, and scientific computing. My curiosity led me to apply for visiting student status at UC Berkeley and San Francisco State, where I am currently taking graduate and upper-division coursework in theoretical statistics.

In the past, I coached high school students for the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) helping them promote to the Silver and Gold divisions. I also taught coursework in AP Computer Science, and was a teaching assistant for my high school's introductory computer science classes before I left in grade 10 to attend community college.

Aside from academics, I play piano, [cosplay](), and walk [my dogs]() for fun. I also enjoy listening to [J-rock](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAdBU-8zvj-W6T5hzwg3VrA), and drinking homemade matcha. If you're equally interested in any of the above, let's chat! My email is [aprilschen6@gmail.com](mailto:aprilschen6@gmail.com).

You can find various things that I work on around my website. Below are my coursework and some course notes I've taken, as well as links to projects and other miscellaneous fun things I've made over the years. Some pointers to things I think you'll find interesting:

 - My professional information, being my experiences and my resume.
 - My websites for personal projects
 - My course notes for Math 185 (Berkeley) and Math 710 (SF State).
 - My supplementary papers from my Real Analysis class.
 - My blog, where I talk about topics important to me.

Coursework
======
Here's an abridged summary of the classes I have taken.

I had to move twice during community college, which led me to take classes from multiple institutions. [You can find a map of all the places I studied here](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). I've also recorded the college where I took each course below.
